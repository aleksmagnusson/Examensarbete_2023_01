# Examensarbete_2023_01

This is my project degree where I am comparing code from Figma to CopyCat / builder.io / self-written code to vsCode to see the results of my drafts in Figma.

"Hi and welcome to my project degree (B-upsats)" where I am examine the plugins who convertes code from a Figma Mockup to VsCode and see how fast an UI/UX expertee can use these plugins and tools to further develop sites for an developer.

All three maps: CopyCat, builder.io and ownBuild is made from scratch with Vite ```npm run vite@latest``` and you install all the packages with ```npm run install``` if you clone these repositories. To more in dept my assignment will come closer to the date of 27th of Jan 2023 for my solutions and results from this assignment.

More in dept will come here as well in my own B-degree assignment.
